The reason was significant: &quot;We were actually one of the few people who, it turned out, had a Linux box on a very busy multiprotocol network.&quot; That is, they were testing the code in a new and extreme situation. [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% &quot;The thing about busy networks is you get very large amounts of data and you also get interesting timings,&quot; Cox explains. &quot;One of the big problems debugging a networking setup is a lot of timing-related bugs only show up on busy networks. So people were seeing that code as being not stable, but it would fall over every few days. Whereas we were in a position where the same bug would fall over every few minutes.&quot; [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% Cox appreciated that what seemed to be bad luck (that their busy network caused the networking code to fall over quickly) was a stroke of fortune for Linux because &quot;we had a great testing ground for it.&quot; As a result, he says, &quot;I started sending Ross fixes.&quot; Ross Biro stopped then working on the networking code, and Fred van Kempen took over. [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% Cox does not hide his skepticism about Fred van Kempen's plans: &quot;Fred decided that he was going to rewrite it all, grand wondrous vision, everything out of Fred Brooks [of /The Mythical Man-Month/ fame] you shouldn't do. In the meantime, while he was doing that, I started releasing patches which were basically just a collection of fixes.&quot; [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% As the Networking-Howto puts it, he did this with &quot;some good success and his first version of Linux networking code was called 'Net-2D(ebugged).' The code worked reliably in many typical configurations and the user base was happy. Alan clearly had ideas and skills of his own to contribute to the project and many discussions relating to the direction the net-2 code was heading ensued.&quot; These discussions sharpened until &quot;there developed two distinct schools within the Linux networking community, one that had the philosophy of 'make it work first, then make it better' and the other of 'make it better first,'&quot; as the Networking-Howto puts it.

They decided to try out Ross Biro recently released networking code. We put </ins>[<ins>the PC] in the campus </ins>[<ins>network</ins>]<ins>&quot; he says, &quot;and we plugged it in and we booted the wondrous TCP/IP code -- and it fell over.

[[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.misc/msg/6550504c2e149d35|#]]<br /><br />%box% &quot;So we started putting newer versions on it, and the machine would fall over more or less regularly each time&quot; despite the updated code, Cox recalls. The reason was significant: &quot;We were actually one of the few people who, it turned out, had a Linux box on a very busy multiprotocol network.&quot; That is, they were testing the code in a new and extreme situation. [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% &quot;The thing about busy networks is you get very large amounts of data and you also get interesting timings,&quot; Cox explains. &quot;One of the big problems debugging a networking setup is a lot of timing-related bugs only show up on busy networks. So people were seeing that code as being not stable, but it would fall over every few days. Whereas we were in a position where the same bug would fall over every few minutes.&quot; [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% Cox appreciated that what seemed to be bad luck (that their busy network caused the networking code to fall over quickly) was a stroke of fortune for Linux because &quot;we had a great testing ground for it.&quot; As a result, he says, &quot;I started sending Ross fixes.&quot; Ross Biro stopped then working on the networking code, and Fred van Kempen took over. [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% Cox does not hide his skepticism about Fred van Kempen's plans: &quot;Fred decided that he was going to rewrite it all, grand wondrous vision, everything out of Fred Brooks [of /The Mythical Man-Month/ fame] you shouldn't do. In the meantime, while he was doing that, I started releasing patches which were basically just a collection of fixes.&quot; [[&lt;&lt;]] [--The Rebel Code : the inside story of Linux and the open source revolution / Glyn Moody, pages 76-77, ISBN 9780738206707 0738203335--]<br /><br />%box% As the Networking-Howto puts it, he did this with &quot;some good success and his first version of Linux networking code was called 'Net-2D(ebugged).' The code worked reliably in many typical configurations and the user base was happy. Alan clearly had ideas and skills of his own to contribute to the project and many discussions relating to the direction the net-2 code was heading ensued.&quot; These discussions sharpened until &quot;there developed two distinct schools within the Linux networking community, one that had the philosophy of 'make it work first, then make it better' and the other of 'make it better first,'&quot; as the Networking-Howto puts it.

        <div class='diffadd'><div class='diffmarkup'><ins>!About SUCS<br />%rframe% Path:/archive/2006/sucslogo.png | [-The SUCS Logo-]<br />'''Swansea University Computer Society''', known as '''SUCS''', is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_society|student society]] at the [[http://www.swan.ac.uk/|University of Wales, Swansea]]. It offers [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing|computing facilities]] and social events to its members and other Swansea University societies.<br /><br />As of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005|2005]], SUCS had in excess of 180 members, making it one of the largest societies in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University|University]]. Its membership comprises [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students|students]], postgraduates, and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumni|alumni]] who have earned life membership from the society. A number of other Swansea University societies are also members of SUCS and take advantage of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer|computer]] facilities and 24 hour access that the society provides.<br /><br />!!History<br />The first documented executive [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee|committee]] of the society were Andy Parkman, Alex Williams and Robin O'Leary in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988|1988]]. At this point in time the society was a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science|computer science]] society. In the early [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s|1990s]] the university computer centre donated the society an old [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCR_Corporation|NCR TOWER 16/32]] system. This was used to provide a variety of services including a bulletin board as well as to teach students system administration skills. At the time the university had large centralised computer systems so the computer science department had no way to teach such skills. Over time the membership became less computer science focused and the society became the computer society, and then to fit student union rules at the time the Swansea University Computer Society. Since then it has gone from strength to strength, gaining its own computer room in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_Union|Students' Union]] building and establishing its own small [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network|network]] of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29|servers]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstations|workstations]].<br /><br />[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cox|Alan Cox]] used one of the SUCS computers to help reproduce major problems in the early [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux|Linux]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP|TCP/IP]] stack. Due to the SUCS machine being on a bridged university network making extensive use of other [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol|protocols]], it was seeing more unusual traffic patterns in a couple of hours that other Linux developers would see in a week. [[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.misc/msg/6550504c2e149d35|#]]<br /><br />Up until the 2.4.19 kernel SUCS was also name-checked in the Linux TCP/IP stack:<br /><br />%define=box block bgcolor=#ffffff padding=1em border=&quot;1px dashed #e76808&quot;%<br /><br />%box% [@<br />Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.4<br />Based upon Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039<br />@]<br /><br />!!Constitution<br />The (non-technical) [[http://sucs.org/About/Staff|executive committee]] is made up of an annually elected president, a treasurer, a secretary and, as of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000|2000]], a publicity officer. Additionally, an [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator|admin]] team made up of some of the most competent and experienced SUCS members exists to offer [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support|technical support]] and administration of the SUCS network. Elections for new executive committees are held at the end of the calendar year.<br /><br />!!The SUCS Room<br />In 1999, The Students' Union allowed SUCS to set up a room of workstations for its members. This was originally on the third floor of the Student Union building in what used to be a debating room. Since this room is inside the building, it is only accessible during the hours the whole building is open.<br /><br />In the summer of 1999 the society was moved to a much smaller room on the ground floor. Despite the small size of the new room, this was generally considered to be a Good Thing since the room now had its own external door. SUCS fitted a magnetic stripe card reader and electronic lock to the door which enabled 24/7 access to the room by the members. The door was connected to an old PC through an interface designed by Justin Mitchell (A.K.A. Arthur) and controlled through software written by Justin Mitchell and Steve Hill (A.K.A. FireFury). The software was originally intended to be a stop-gap measure until something nicer looking could be written, but it stayed in service until the summer of 2005 when the card reader finally gave up. Replacement hardware was ordered and new software written by Dave Arter (A.K.A. davea).<br /><br />!!Computer Systems<br />SUCS has a network of around ten desktop computers which are available around the clock for use by its members. These run the Red Hat-sponsored Linux distribution, Fedora Core, except for the gateway connecting it to the University network, which runs Debian GNU/Linux. Members can also access their files remotely and connect their own laptops to the network in the society's computer room. Among the services provided by the society are web space, spam filtered email, free laser printing, a growing library of computer related books, mailing lists and a programming advisory service.<br /><br />!!Community<br />As well as meeting each other in the SUCS computer room (known colloquially as &quot;the room&quot;), members also log into the society's bulletin board and talker called Milliways III (named after the restaurant in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). Non-members are also welcome on Milliways and a number of non-members and ex-members can often be found there. The community on Milliways III is usually quite jovial and the combination of younger members (who bring new technologies and viewpoints to the group) and older, more experienced graduates, can be very technically helpful.<br /><br />Traditionally, at the end of the academic year, SUCS holds a beach party on Swansea beach. The party attracts many of the ex-members and life members as well as the current members and serves well as a reunion for those who have left the Swansea area. The party usually involves a barbecue, bonfire and beer and usually runs from around 19:00 through until after sunrise.<br /><br />The more enthusiastic SUCS members regularly set themselves interesting programming and system development projects, both personal and group projects with other members. Examples of personal projects are personal websites, utility programs and scripts to help with SUCS administration, instant messaging software and ipod interface software development and PIC microcontroller programming.<br /><br />!!External Link<br />* [[http://sucs.org|Swansea University Computer Society website]]</ins></div></div></div>
