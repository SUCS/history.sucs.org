Behind the duck pond)</ins>.<ins>&nbsp;This room had to be kept locked, and only one postgrad had access to it (Robin). The machine would occasionally crash and need rebooting, and we couldn't always pester Robin. So there was a long piece of string tied around the reboot switch (which was a switch rather than a button) </ins>and <ins>this string ran out of the room through the keyhole. When a reboot was needed,</ins> we <ins>pulled the string. This honestly worked, although occasionally it came off in your hand, and there was a memorable occasion when someone inside the room cut the string. At some stage a replacement piece of string was billed to the union under a name of &quot;Emergency manual reboot mechanism&quot; or some such. This was the case until about 1991. <br /><br />The limited number of connections available could be used either to login to accounts on the machine, or for the public to connect to the [[http://www.earth.ox.ac.uk/~steve/bullet.html|Bullet]] BBS System that we ran under the name Milliways. The public connected in a room just off to the left of the entrance, the 24-hour terminal room with vt220 clones. You could 'reserve' a terminal for post-pub by messing with the terminal settings. Most comp sci students had no idea about this, and would find another terminal. The ones who did know would then waltz in and fix the terminal to play MIST at 2am, or AberMUD (except that in those days, pre-TCP/IP, it was possible to just turn AberMUD off for the duration of the exams, and this would actually work and stop people from wasting time on the net). <br /><br />The number of connections being very limited, and also being open to the public, a very strict timeout system was being ran which ensured that there was always one line left open for society members to login, and would ruthelessly timeout anyone, and kick off anonymous users in order to achieve this. It was named 'wowbagger' for its rudeness. It may be time now to admit that one or two Galaxy admins knew how to boot specific 'guest' users off at will using this program. <br /><br />Once we had migrated from the computer science tower down to the computer centre reception area, a second NCR Tower</ins> was added, and named Inferno (obvious bad puns are intentional), this gave more processing power to spread the load a little more.</div></div></div>
